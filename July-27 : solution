2210. Count Hills and Valleys in an Array
Solution:
class Solution:
    def countHillValley(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Remove consecutive duplicates to simplify checking
        filtered = [nums[0]]
        for num in nums[1:]:
            if num != filtered[-1]:
                filtered.append(num)
        
        count = 0
        # Check each element (except first and last) if it's a hill or valley
        for i in range(1, len(filtered)-1):
            if filtered[i] > filtered[i-1] and filtered[i] > filtered[i+1]:
                count += 1  # Hill
            elif filtered[i] < filtered[i-1] and filtered[i] < filtered[i+1]:
                count += 1  # Valley
        
        return count
